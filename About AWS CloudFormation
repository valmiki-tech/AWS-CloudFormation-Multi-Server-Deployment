AWS CloudFormation: Overview & Key Concepts
🚀 What is AWS CloudFormation?
AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and provision AWS resources in an automated and repeatable way using YAML or JSON templates.

With CloudFormation, you can:
✅ Automate infrastructure deployment
✅ Manage AWS resources consistently
✅ Easily update & roll back changes
✅ Ensure repeatability & compliance

🛠️ How CloudFormation Works
Write a Template – Define AWS resources (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.) in YAML/JSON
Create a Stack – Deploy resources using the template
Manage the Stack – Update, delete, or modify resources through CloudFormation
📌 Key Components
1️⃣ Templates – Define resources, configurations, and dependencies
2️⃣ Stacks – A collection of AWS resources managed as a unit
3️⃣ StackSets – Deploy stacks across multiple AWS accounts & regions
4️⃣ Change Sets – Preview changes before applying them to a stack

💡 Example CloudFormation YAML Template
Deploys an EC2 instance with Nginx installed:


AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-09a9858973b288bdd
      InstanceType: t3.micro
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - sg-0e11ab30c5c9f59d1
      KeyName: my-keypair
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64: |
          #!/bin/bash
          sudo apt update -y
          sudo apt install nginx -y
          sudo systemctl start nginx
